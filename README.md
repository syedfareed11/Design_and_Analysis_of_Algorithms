# Sorting Algorithms and Snakes and Ladders Analysis
## Question 1: Basic Sorting Algorithms Implementation and Analysis
Implemented Algorithms
In-place Quick Sort
Merge Sort
In-place Heap Sort
Insertion Sort
Bucket Sort
Radix Sort
#### Evaluation Metrics
Number of comparisons (if applicable)

Number of swaps (if applicable)

Number of basic operations (other than above)

Running time in milliseconds

Memory used

## Question 2: Improvements to Quick Sort and Merge Sort
Improvements
Quick Sort: Hybrid approach with Insertion Sort.
Merge Sort: Memory optimization using Timsort.
#### Evaluation Metrics
Comparison with basic implementations regarding running time, memory usage, and efficiency.


## Question 3: Snakes and Ladders Board Game Verification and Solution
Tasks
Verify the board satisfies the following conditions:
At least one way to reach the goal.
No two snakes/ladders start or end at the same grid position.
No cycles formed by the combination of snakes and ladders.
No ladder from the start position to the destination directly.
Solve the Snakes and Ladders game to reach the goal fastest.
