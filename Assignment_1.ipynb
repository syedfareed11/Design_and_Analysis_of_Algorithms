    "## Question 3:\n",
    "Snakes and Ladders is a classic board game, originating in India no later than the 16th\n",
    "century. The board consists of an n × n grid of squares, numbered consecutively from 1\n",
    "to n 2 , starting in the bottom left corner and proceeding row by row from bottom to top,\n",
    "with rows alternating to the left and right. Certain pairs of squares in this grid, always in\n",
    "different rows, are connected by either “snakes” (leading down) or “ladders” (leading up).\n",
    "Each square can be an endpoint of at most one snake or ladder. The goal is to reach the\n",
    "nxn th grid position or the paramapatam fastest.\n",
    "You start with a token in cell 1, in the bottom left corner. In each move, you advance your\n",
    "token up to k positions, for some fixed constant k. If the token ends the move at the top\n",
    "end of a snake, it slides down to the bottom of that snake. Similarly, if the token ends the\n",
    "move at the bottom end of a ladder, it climbs up to the top of that ladder\n",
    "The following are the two tasks\n",
    "1. You are given a board. It is represented by a. the size nxn (n is at least 8), b. number of\n",
    "snakes, and number of ladders, and c. the start and destination grid positions of the\n",
    "snakes and ladders in the board. You have to verify if the board satisfies the following\n",
    "conditions:\n",
    "1. There is at least one way to reach the goal\n",
    "2. No two snakes/ladders start or end at the same grid position. ( can’t process the\n",
    "input directly)\n",
    "3. There is no cycles formed by the combination of snakes and ladders.\n",
    "4. There is no ladder from the start position to the destination directly.\n",
